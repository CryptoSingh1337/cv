  <ul>
    <li><strong>Password Rack</strong>
      <p>Password Rack is a password storing application which stores passwords
        in local Database and<br>In order to store password user have to create a
        new account, then login and after that user will<br>be able to store Passwords

    <li><strong>Finding Genes From DNA</strong>
      <p>This project I made during my Course on Coursera. It basically find all the Genes from DNA<br>
        with "ATG" StartCodon and "TAA", "TAG", "TGA" StopCodon at the end.
        It also have some features like :</p>
      <ol type="i">
        <li>Counting No. of Genes in that DNA.</li>
        <li>Calculating the CG Ratio.</li>
        <li>Count No. of "CTG" strand in DNA.</li>
        <li>Calculating the Length of Longest Gene.</li>
        <li>Counting all the Genes which have length > 60 and having CG Ratio > 0.35.</li>
        <li>Displaying all the Genes.</li>
      </ol>

    <li><strong>Image Conversion</strong>
      <p>Convert Images into GrayScale or Negative<br>
        This project I made during the completion of Course (as a Honor Project) on Coursera.</p>
      <ol type="i">
        <li>Converts all the colored Images of any Size into GrayScale.</li>
        <li>Converts all the colored Images of any Size into Negative.</li>
        <li>Save the Image with "gray-" or "inverted-" in the beginning of Image name.</li>
      </ol>

    <li><strong>Wireless Robotic Hand</strong>
      <p>I had worked on my school project i.e. Wireless Robotic Hand Using Arduino R3.
        I completed this<br>project alone from designing to programming.<br>
